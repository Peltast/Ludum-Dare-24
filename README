My submission for the 24th Ludum Dare competition, in which all content must be made in the space of 48 hours or declared before the competition begins.  For my submission all code is original.

In the spirit of the exercise I am not changing the master branch at all from the original source.  Any fixes, changes or expansions will take place in other branches.
